# Emoji quiz & Flag quiz

{% hint style="info" %}
The emoji quiz and flag quiz work very similarly. Many functions and commands will have a very similar structure.
{% endhint %}

### Information

* Skips: If you don't know the flag or the term, you can skip. At the beginning you have 10 skips and you get three per vote.
* ~~Reply: If the answer is incorrect, the message is responded to with a "‚ùå".~~ Changed in update from [v1.15.md](../changelogs/v1.15.md "mention")

### Management

* You set up the system with using `/emojiquiz` or `/flagquiz`. This requires the <mark style="color:orange;">Manage Guild</mark> permission.
