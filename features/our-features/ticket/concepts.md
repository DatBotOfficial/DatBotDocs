### Autoclaim

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure that the staff members have the "claim" permission, otherwise this will not work.
{% endhint %}

Autoclaim is a system that allows the automatic claim after wrting a message in a ticket. The user needs the Claim or Admin permission to use this feature. The permission can be added in the [settings.md](settings.md "mention").

### Only One Mode

Only One Mode only allows one staff member to write in a ticket after claiming it. If unclaimed, everyone can write in the ticket again until another staff member claims it. Can be enabled in [settings.md](settings.md "mention").

### Closerequests

Closerequests are used to ask for the permission to close a ticket. The user and the staff can send a close request and the other person can accept or reject the close request.

### Blocking

Blocking works on the whole server and just for a category. If category is selected, the user will not be able to create a ticket with the selected settings ([#settings](concepts.md#settings "mention")) anymore.

### Feedback

If enabled, after the deletion of a ticket a user will get the possibility to provide feedback about a ticket in their DMs. Under the transcript message, they have the possibility to give up to 5 ‚≠ê. Can be enabled in [settings.md](settings.md "mention").

Modals are Discord's option to easily and safely get user input data. "General Support" is the title in this instance. A modal can have up to 5 fields. One field contains of a label, for example "Your Ingame Name" and if provided a placeholder, in this instance "byPixelTV". A field can be required or not. This is how a Modal looks like:\
