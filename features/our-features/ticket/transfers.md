# Transfers

### General

Transfers: Within the Ticket, as long as it is a text channel, you have the possibility to transfer a Ticket. This is made for specific use cases, for example Unban Support. In this fictional example, the Unban Support is used if a user is banned on Twitch or Discord. If the staff member is not able to help, they can transfer the Ticket to the Twitch Unban Staff of the Discord Server. Transfers are linked to a Settings Model and only usable on the Guild they were created on. You are able to link them to multipe Setting Models.
