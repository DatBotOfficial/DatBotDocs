# Setup

1. Create a Panel using `/ticket panel create` . Read more here: [panels.md](panels.md "mention")
2. Create Settings using `/ticket settings create` and customize your settings. Read more here: [settings.md](settings.md "mention")
3. Link the Settings to the Panel: [#linked-settings](panels.md#linked-settings "mention")
4. If needed, customize your components of the panel: [#components](panels.md#components "mention") and [#manage-button-components](panels.md#manage-button-components "mention")
5. Send the panel with `/ticket panel send`

Done! This is everything you have to do. Setting up the system and getting used to it, but once you are used to it it is pretty easy.
