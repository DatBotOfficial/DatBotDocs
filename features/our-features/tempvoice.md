# TempVoice

### Presets

Presets are used to create a TempVoice Channel with customized settings.

#### Possibilites

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/grafik.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Create and use

Create a preset with `/tempvoice presets create [name]` and customize your settings. You can edit an existing preset with `/tempvoice presets edit [preset]`.

To use a preset, use the command `/tempvoice presets load`. If you don't wanna use the preset anymore, use `/tempvoice presets unload`.

#### Permissions

You can add custom permissions by clicking on `[+] Permissions`. You can add permissions for a user or a role, the user permissions are global, the role permissions are for the guild you edit the preset on. It uses a custom permission system that allows you to specificly allow actions.



* <mark style="color:red;">Administrator</mark>: Instead of giving every other single permission, you can give this permission instead.
* <mark style="color:red;">Manage Bans</mark>: Ban or unban users
* <mark style="color:red;">Manage Moderators</mark>: Manage the TempVoice channel moderators
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Manage Channel Properties</mark>: Manage the name, bitrate, userlimit, status (currently not available), region, NSFW status and video quality
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Kick Members</mark>: Disconnect members
* <mark style="color:blue;">Manage Locking</mark>: Lock or unlock the channel
* <mark style="color:blue;">Manage Visibility</mark>: Make the channel visible or invisible
* <mark style="color:blue;">Manage Invites</mark>: Invite users or remove invites. They can join even if the channel is invisible and/or locked.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-03-07 161635.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>This is how the error message looks if you have been banned.</p></figcaption></figure>

* This error appears if you have been banned from the system by a server moderator.&#x20;
* This ban is not global.
* This means that you can no longer create or manage temporary voice channels.

#### How to remove a server ban

_<mark style="color:yellow;">Note: To be unbanned, you have to ask an Administrator to unban you.</mark>_&#x20;

1. The moderator has to use `/tempvoice settings`

### Functions

  * You can manage the temporary voice channel with the interface.

### Set-Up

1. Use /tempvoice setup and click in the "Continue" button.
2.  Select the type.

    Quick: If you choose this option,  the bot creates a category, a text channel, in which it sends the interface and creates a voice channel, which is functioning as the creator channel.

    Manual: Set the creator channel and send the interface manually

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-03-07 170134.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>You have to click on the select menu to select a type.</p></figcaption></figure>

3. If you chose "Quick", the bot will create everything for you. If you want to change settings, use `/tempvoice settings`
4. If you chose Manual, you first have to choose, which voice channel the creator channel should be.&#x20;

5. After doing so, you have to send the Interface. Choose a channel and the bot will send the interface in this channel.
