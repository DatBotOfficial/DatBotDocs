* <mark style="color:red;">Transfers</mark>: Within the Ticket, as long as it is a text channel, you have the possibility to <mark style="color:yellow;">transfer a Ticket</mark>. This is made for specific use cases, <mark style="color:blue;">for example Unban Support</mark>. In this <mark style="color:green;">fictional</mark> example, the Unban Support is used if a user is banned on <mark style="color:purple;">Twitch</mark> or <mark style="color:blue;">Discord</mark>.
