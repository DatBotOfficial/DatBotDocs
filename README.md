Hello y'all!

I am Gamet, the founder of Dat Bot and developer. I started this project back in April of 2022 as a fun way to learn programming and growing a community. Nowadays, it has grown and is bigger than I thought it could ever get. Thank you for using Dat Bot! :tada:

Hey ho

I'm Voroniyx, have known Gamet since April 2023, have been using DatBot since the end of 2023 and have been a developer on the DatBot team since mid-October '24. When I'm not working on DatBot, I have my own small projects or play something. I try to help here and if you ever see me on the support server dont be to shy and say hello.

Hey everyone!

I'm byPixelTV, one of the staff members of Dat Bot. I started using the bot in April 2023 and have always been helping users more or less on the support server. I still help people on the support server, but I also like to develop Minecraft plugins in my free time. Maybe we'll see each other on the support server, but for now I just want to say: Thanks for using Dat Bot! ðŸŽ‰

Bye ðŸ‘‹
